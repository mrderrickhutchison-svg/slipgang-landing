THE PROBLEM
Sportsbooks don't want you to see all your bets at once.
Their apps are designed to get you placing new bets, not monitoring old ones. You can't even see a simple list of all your active wagers. With multiple books, it's chaos.
😤
Tapping into each bet one by one on FanDuel
🔄
Switching between 3-4 sportsbook apps constantly
📱
Missing a parlay leg hitting while checking another app
🤷
No idea what your actual P&L is across books
😴
Manually tracking bets in a spreadsheet
